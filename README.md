# My BookListApp

Responsive app used to add or delete books as per need. This book tracking app is easy to handle and use. Plus, data is handled using localstorage. 
Nice user interface with respective alerts on deletion or additon of a particular book. Some validations like, no two books with same name or ISBN can co-exist, 
are handled.
